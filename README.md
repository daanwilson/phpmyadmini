# phpmyadmini
Looking for a mysql database administration tool written in PHP and you don't want to use the populair phpmyadmin because its to big / large. Then this is THE solution.

A full responsive php administration tool written in one file in less then 50kB. It uses jquery and bootstrap 3. These files are loaded external from the site https://ajax.googleapis.com and https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com
If you want to load the files localy within your own project, no problem, this is easy configurable.

- view databases
- view tables
- view table records
- edit table records
- search table records easyly
- view table structures
- view table creation
- export tables (sql/gz)
- easy configurable

Have fun with it. Find any bugs, please let me know or fix them en push them fix to github
